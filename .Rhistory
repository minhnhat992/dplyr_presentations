So, What is Data Wrangling ?
========================================================
Manipulate your "raw" data into different forms
Examples
* Filtering/sorting data
* Calculate new columns from existing Ones
* Removing or rename empty cells/values
* Merge/join different table together
* Create Excel-like pivot tables to summarize your data
Why is it important ?
========================================================
- 80% of a data scientist's time will be spent on cleaning data
- Your boss will likely ask you to do it!
Why use R for data manipulation ?
========================================================
- Faster than Excel
- Automate the process, no more manual works!
- Huge support on data wrangling. You can manipulate date using either :
+ Base R codes
+ Packages such as [**dplyr**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)
So, What is dplyr ? Why you should know it ?
========================================================
- It is an [**R package**](http://www.statmethods.net/interface/packages.html) - program that someone wrote and shared to the public
- Created by Hadley Wickham
- Advantages over base R
+ Faster
+ Easier to learn and understand
Example
========================================================
Let's use an example of Flights data! A dataset of 336776 flights departed from NYC in 2013
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
```
# Chunk 1: setup
opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
)
nrow(baseball)
